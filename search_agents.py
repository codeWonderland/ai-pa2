    This heuristic must be consistent to ensure correctness.  First, try to

    If using A* ever finds a solution that is worse then uniform cost search
    finds, your heuristic is *not* consistent, and probably not admissible!
    On the other hand, inadmissible or inconsistent heuristics may find optimal
    solutions, so be careful.

    The state is a tuple (pacman_position, food_grid) where food_grid is a Grid
    (see game.py) of either True or False. You can call food_grid.as_list() to
    get a list of food coordinates instead.

    If you want access to info like walls, capsules, etc., you can query the
    problem.  For example, problem.walls gives you a Grid of where the walls
    are.

    If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the
    heuristic, there is a dictionary called problem.heuristic_info that you can
    use. For example, if you only want to count the walls once and store that
    value, try: problem.heuristic_info['wall_count'] = problem.walls.count()
